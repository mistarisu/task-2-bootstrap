              Day 1: Nusa Dua and Uluwatu
            </button>

          <div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse">
            <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>Upon arriving in Bali, you should naturally head to the beach, so the first stop on this itinerary is the resort area of Nusa Dua. Located in southern Bali, Nusa Dua is just a 20-minute drive from Ngurah Rai International Airport. It is a fantastic area for families but a great spot for all travelers to begin their Bali adventure and unwind after a long flight. The top activities here are relaxing, shopping, and sightseeing: just what you need to get geared up for your vacation!</p>

                <p><strong>Nusa Dua Beach and Waterblow</strong></p>
                <p>Nusa Dua Beach is a picture-perfect stretch of clean and well-maintained sand along the scenic southern Bali peninsula. It is flanked by palm trees and beach resorts on one side and warm, blue-green water on the other. You can find all of your favorite beach activities here, including swimming and sunbathing. If you’ve brought along your snorkeling gear, then you can even take in the underwater sights! Nusa Dua Beach is also a prime location for exciting water sports like Flyboard and parasailing, for those who want to start their vacation with an adrenaline rush!</p>
                
                <p>The top, must-see attraction on Nusa Dua Beach is Waterblow. This is an area along the peninsula where large waves from the Indian Ocean crash against the limestone cliffs and are channeled into a narrow crag that sends the water shooting upwards, like from a whale’s spout. During periods of high tide between July and October, the impressive spray can reach almost 100 feet! From Waterblow, you can also enjoy 240-degree views out over the ocean water, which makes for some stunning photos.</p>

                <p><strong>Uluwatu</strong></p>
                <p>For the second half of your first day in Bali, it’s time to head to Uluwatu. Located about a half-hour drive from Waterblow, Uluwatu lies on the southernmost tip of the island. The serene town is known for having a laid-back atmosphere as well as some of the prettiest beaches, bluest waters, and most dramatic cliffs. There is also a great mix of luxury and more affordable accommodations here where you can spend your first night. Before checking out the town and relaxing for the evening, however, you should pay a visit to the most important attraction in the area: Uluwatu Temple.</p>

                <p><strong>Uluwatu Temple</strong></p>
                <p>Just past town, situated on the coast, lies Uluwatu Temple. Perched high on the edge of a cliff, Uluwatu Temple is considered to be one of the most important temples in Bali. You can explore the temple for a fee of just 30,000 IDR per adult and 15,000 IDR per child. Take in the many beautiful carved statues and traditional architecture. You will also likely encounter some of the temple’s resident monkeys. These cheeky creatures are known for snatching visitors’ belongings, so make sure you watch your things and remove any jewelry. The best time to visit Uluwatu Temple is around sunset, when the daily Kecak Fire Dance is held in the amphitheater. As you watch the performance, you can also delight in the stunning background sunset.</p>

              Day 2: Seminyak
            </button>
          </h2>
          <div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse">
            <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>For day two of your Bali adventure, start with a 40-minute drive from Uluwatu to the upscale area of Seminyak. One of the more developed and touristy resort towns on the island, this trendy locale offers a great mix of beaches, cultural sites, shopping, dining, nightlife, and more. It is also known for having magical sunset views and stellar surf spots. Get ready for a full day, and make sure your schedule includes a stop at each of the following four attractions.</p>

                <p><strong>Nyaman Gallery</strong></p>
                <p>The easiest first stop on a Bali itinerary once you’ve entered Seminyak is Nyaman Gallery, a contemporary art gallery located in the heart of town. The word “nyaman” translates into “cozy” or “comfortable,” and that’s precisely the feeling you’ll get when you walk in. Enjoy traditional Bali charm and hospitality as you view art created by local and Indonesian artists, including paintings, sculptures, ceramics, hand-blown glass, and photographs. Almost everything in the gallery is for sale, so you can even do some shopping for one-of-a-kind art and jewelry to decorate your own home or to bring back as souvenirs for loved ones. Best of all, it’s completely free to come in and look around!</p>

                <p><strong>Petitenget Temple</strong></p>
                <p>Just like Uluwatu, Seminyak has its own coastal temple known as Petitenget Temple. Constructed in the 16th century, it is one of the only cultural attractions in the area, and so is a highly recommended visit while you are here. Petitenget Temple is an active place of worship, but tourists are welcome to come and look around for an entrance fee of 50,000 IDR per person. It is a fairly small and compact temple featuring traditional Balinese architecture, scenic views, and relaxing garden spaces. Many religious ceremonies take place at the temple throughout the year, and you might be able to catch one if you are lucky.</p>

                <p><strong>Seminyak Beach</strong></p>
                <p>When vacationing on the coast of Bali, you should never miss an opportunity to spend some time at the beach. Seminyak Beach is a popular stretch of lovely golden sand that tends to feel less crowded than other top beaches in the area. It’s a great place to go swimming, and there are some excellent spots for surfing as well. You can also rent a sun lounger and simply soak in the sun with a cold drink in-hand. There are plenty of public facilities around and numerous restaurants nearby. Once you’re at the beach, you should aim to hang out long enough to catch the spectacular sunset.</p>

                <p><strong>Seminyak Night Market</strong></p>
                <p>After you’ve taken in the sunset at Seminyak Beach, venture into town again for the Seminyak Night Market. Starting around 6 p.m., the street food stalls around Seminyak begin selling delicious hot meals and Balinese treats. Among the most popular offerings are fish, barbecued prawns, and all sorts of satay meats. Hop from stall to stall until you get your fill of the best Indonesian cuisine. Adding the market to your Bali itinerary is a great way to sample a wide variety of local food in one sitting. Best of all, Seminyak Night Market is known for being easy on the wallet. The popular night market has a lively energy, and the vendors and locals have a reputation for being very friendly.</p>

              Day 3: Canggu
            </button>
          </h2>
          <div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse">
            <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>Start your third day in Bali with a 40-minute drive from Seminyak to Canggu. Once a sleepy village, Canggu has risen considerably in popularity over the past few years. It is now home to numerous trendy cafes, affordable resorts, bars, beach clubs, a growing number of yoga studios, and a large population of digital nomads. The village is mainly known for its numerous beaches and its shopping scene, as well as for nearby Tanah Lot Temple. Let yourself enjoy a less structured day and take your pick of some beaches and shops that you would most like to visit.</p>

                <p><strong>Canggu Beaches</strong></p>
                <p>One of the best ways to start a day in Canggu is by going beach-hopping. The coastline of the village is divided into five beaches, each with its own unique character. Whether you are interested in surfing, swimming, sun tanning, or sightseeing, there’s a beach for everyone in Canggu.</p>

                <p><strong>Shopping in Canggu</strong></p>
                <p>Canggu has a higher concentration of fashion stores than perhaps anywhere else in Bali. You will find both boutique island brands and designer labels everywhere you look. It is a great stop to add to your Bali itinerary and a perfect place to upgrade your wardrobe and pick out some new outfits for the rest of your travels.</p>

                <p><strong>Tanah Lot Temple</strong></p>
                <p>A 25-minute drive from Canggu, Tanah Lot Temple is built on top of a large rock formation just off-shore. The name “Tanah Lot” itself translates to “land in the sea.” The architecture of the temple melds harmoniously with the rocky outcrop. It is accessed via a land bridge lined with a variety of souvenir stalls where you can pick up local handicrafts, food and drink, and accessories like sandals, sarongs, and t-shirts. The entry fee for Tanah Lot Temple is a bit higher than most other temples in Bali, at 60,000 IDR for adults and 30,000 IDR for children. However, the temple’s unique location and status as one of the most iconic temples in Bali certainly make the price worth it. The best time to visit Tanah Lot Temple is during sunset, when the surrounding sea is painted gold.</p>

                Day 4: Ubud
              </button>
            </h2>
            <div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseFour" class="accordion-collapse collapse">
              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>After enjoying the best that Bali‘s coast has to offer, it’s time to head inland to Ubud, the spiritual, cultural, and artistic heart of the island. Ubud is the center of both traditional dance and crafts in Bali. There is also an abundance of yoga studios and retreats. The journey through the countryside to reach this special locale is a magical experience in and of itself. You’ll be making your way through scenic rice paddies and picturesque ravines of the foothills. No Bali itinerary is complete without a visit to Ubud. Before making your way into town, however, it is recommended that you make a stop at Tegenungan Waterfall.</p>

                <p><strong>Tegenungan Waterfall</strong></p>
                <p>Tegenungan Waterfall is located about a one-hour drive from Canggu and half an hour out from Ubud. It is one of the most famous waterfalls in all of Bali, and definitely worth the stop. The entry fee is not too pricey, at just 20,000 IDR. The trail down from the entrance to the waterfall consists of about 100 steps, and the view from the bottom is truly breathtaking. You’ll also find some fun props to take photos with, including a large swing! Because it is so popular, Tegenungan Waterfall can be quite busy. However, there are many secluded vantage points around where you can take a break from the crowds. Facilities include bathrooms, changing rooms, and cafes so that you can stop for something to eat and drink and even go swimming if it’s a hot day! Tegenungan Waterfall is easily one of the top must-see attractions in Bali.</p>

                <p><strong>Ubud Monkey Forest</strong></p>
                <p>Once you reach Ubud, your first stop should be the Ubud Monkey Forest. Located right in town, it is a sanctuary for Balinese long-tailed monkeys. A visit to Ubud Monkey Forest provides a wonderful opportunity to watch these monkeys in their natural habitat. The reserve doubles as a temple complex, and it is an important spiritual and cultural site. There are more than 700 monkey residents in the forest, in addition to over 150 different species of trees! It’s a great way to immerse yourself in the nature of Ubud. Visitors are asked to please not feed or make any physical contact with the monkeys, but you are more than welcome to come and observe their playful antics. The entrance fee for Ubud Monkey Forest is 80,000 IDR per adult and 60,000 IDR per child.</p>

                <p><strong>Shopping in Ubud</strong></p>
                <p>Make sure you allow plenty of time on the day you arrive in Ubud to do some shopping. Downtown Ubud is the hub of shopping activity in town, offering a great mix of souvenir stalls, fashion stalls, and traditional art stalls. Whether you still need some souvenirs for friends and family back home, or you’re just looking to do a bit of shopping for yourself, you’re sure to find everything you need to complete your Bali shopping experience. There are a variety of traditional and handcrafted products on sale here, meaning that each one is truly one-of-a-kind. Meandering through the winding streets is also a great way to immerse yourself in the local atmosphere.</p>

                Day 5: Ubud Outskirts

            <div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseFive" class="accordion-collapse collapse">
              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>Travelers owe it to themselves to spend at least two days inland when visiting Bali, and Ubud is the perfect jumping-off point for exploring the surrounding rainforest and rice fields. There is plenty to do within a short distance of town and a lot to pack into your final full day on the island. You’ll want to wake up bright and early so that you can beat the crowd to your first stop: Tegallalang Rice Terrace.</p>

                <p><strong>Tegalalang Rice Terrace</strong></p>
                <p>Tegalalang Rice Terrace is only a 20-minute drive north of Ubud. It is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the area, and a must-have destination on any Bali itinerary. The lush, terraced rice fields are an agricultural icon and an enduring symbol of the region. Located in a valley, the rice paddies appear to stretch on endlessly. They are brilliantly green in color, which makes for some truly stunning pictures. There is a small entrance fee of 15,000 IDR per person to walk around the rice fields, so make sure you bring some cash. Visitors can also purchase drinks and snacks. If you’re up for a bit of a thrill, you can try out a jungle swing or a zip line as well! A Bali vacation would not be complete without a visit to Tegalalang Rice Terrace.</p>

                <p><strong>Kehen Temple</strong></p>
                <p>From Tegalalang Rice Terrace, it is a 45-minute drive to the beautiful Kehen Temple. Built into a hillside, this Balinese Hindu temple was established as far back as the 13th century. It once served as the state temple of the Bangli Kingdom, which is today the Regency of Bangli. Set amidst eight terraces and surrounded by trees, the temple has a mystical and relaxing atmosphere. Kehen Temple is considered to be one of the finest temples in eastern Bali, and it is a fantastic example of traditional Balinese architecture. Stone steps will lead you to the main temple area, which houses three courtyards, a gorgeous 11-tiered shrine, and many intricate carvings. There is a 15,000 IDR fee to enter the temple.</p>

                <p><strong>Campuhan Ridge Walk</strong></p>
                <p>The Campuhan Ridge Walk is one of the most popular walking trails in Bali. It is located about an hour away from Kehen Temple and just five minutes outside of Ubud. This relatively short and easy trek along a paved walkway offers spectacular views of the surrounding jungle and the distant mountains. Hikers follow the Campuhan Ridge as it gently slopes upwards and leads to the top of the hill. One of the best times to do the Campuhan Ridge Walk is close to sunset, when the temperatures will be cooler and you won’t have to contend with as many crowds. The colors of the sunset will also paint the greenery in stunning shades of orange and pink. There is no entry fee, and it is a wonderful place to take some of your last photographs in Bali. The Campuhan Ridge Walk is a great way to end your Bali vacation on a high note.</p>
